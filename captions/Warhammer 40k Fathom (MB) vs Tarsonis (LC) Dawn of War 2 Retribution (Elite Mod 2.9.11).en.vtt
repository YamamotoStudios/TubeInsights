00:14:23.150 --> 00:14:23.160 align:start position:0%
stronger assault Cannon so the idea is
 

00:14:23.160 --> 00:14:25.069 align:start position:0%
stronger assault Cannon so the idea is
you've<00:14:23.320><c> got</c><00:14:23.440><c> a</c><00:14:23.560><c> tank</c><00:14:23.839><c> that</c><00:14:24.000><c> does</c><00:14:24.160><c> a</c><00:14:24.360><c> TR</c><00:14:24.800><c> just</c><00:14:24.920><c> a</c>

you've got a tank that does a TR just a

will<00:17:15.520><c> just</c><00:17:15.640><c> Retreat</c><00:17:15.959><c> out</c><00:17:16.120><c> of</c><00:17:16.280><c> it</c><00:17:16.480><c> but</c><00:17:16.600><c> the</c>

00:17:16.710 --> 00:17:16.720 align:start position:0%
will just Retreat out of it but the
 

00:17:16.720 --> 00:17:19.949 align:start position:0%
will just Retreat out of it but the
point<00:17:17.039><c> is</c><00:17:18.039><c> that</c><00:17:18.240><c> it</c><00:17:18.400><c> forces</c><00:17:18.919><c> Retreats</c><00:17:19.679><c> cuz</c><00:17:19.839><c> if</c>

00:17:19.949 --> 00:17:19.959 align:start position:0%
point is that it forces Retreats cuz if
 

00:17:19.959 --> 00:17:21.630 align:start position:0%
point is that it forces Retreats cuz if
they<00:17:20.079><c> don't</c><00:17:20.360><c> they</c><00:17:20.480><c> get</c><00:17:20.640><c> wrecked</c><00:17:21.199><c> you</c><00:17:21.280><c> can</c><00:17:21.439><c> also</c>

00:17:21.630 --> 00:17:21.640 align:start position:0%
they don't they get wrecked you can also
 

00:17:21.640 --> 00:17:23.829 align:start position:0%
they don't they get wrecked you can also
use<00:17:21.799><c> it</c><00:17:21.919><c> to</c><00:17:22.039><c> one</c><00:17:22.280><c> shot</c><00:17:22.439><c> the</c><00:17:22.520><c> bunker</c><00:17:22.919><c> I</c><00:17:23.079><c> believe</c>

00:17:23.829 --> 00:17:23.839 align:start position:0%
use it to one shot the bunker I believe
 

00:17:23.839 --> 00:17:26.309 align:start position:0%
use it to one shot the bunker I believe
so<00:17:24.039><c> that</c><00:17:24.160><c> would</c><00:17:24.280><c> have</c><00:17:24.360><c> been</c><00:17:24.520><c> a</c><00:17:24.640><c> better</c>

00:17:26.309 --> 00:17:26.319 align:start position:0%
so that would have been a better
 

00:17:26.319 --> 00:17:29.070 align:start position:0%
so that would have been a better
play<00:17:27.319><c> but</c><00:17:27.600><c> you</c><00:17:27.760><c> know</c><00:17:27.959><c> you</c><00:17:28.120><c> suppress</c><00:17:28.520><c> the</c><00:17:28.600><c> enemy</c>

00:17:29.070 --> 00:17:29.080 align:start position:0%
play but you know you suppress the enemy
 

00:17:29.080 --> 00:17:30.870 align:start position:0%

00:17:30.870 --> 00:17:30.880 align:start position:0%
double Guardsman with your looters so
 

00:17:30.880 --> 00:17:32.549 align:start position:0%
double Guardsman with your looters so
they<00:17:31.039><c> can't</c><00:17:31.559><c> manually</c><00:17:31.960><c> Dodge</c><00:17:32.240><c> and</c><00:17:32.320><c> then</c><00:17:32.440><c> you</c>

00:17:32.549 --> 00:17:32.559 align:start position:0%
they can't manually Dodge and then you
 

00:17:32.559 --> 00:17:34.230 align:start position:0%
they can't manually Dodge and then you
foot<00:17:32.760><c> of</c><00:17:32.919><c> GK</c><00:17:33.160><c> and</c><00:17:33.240><c> it</c><00:17:33.320><c> forces</c><00:17:33.679><c> a</c><00:17:33.799><c> retreat</c><00:17:34.080><c> on</c>

00:17:34.230 --> 00:17:34.240 align:start position:0%
